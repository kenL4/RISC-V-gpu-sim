These Samples are copied from SIMTight so that we ensure that we're running the same kernels.

Most of these benchmarks are transcribed from NVIDIA's OpenCL / CUDA
samples. Scan is taken from GPU Gems 3 by NVIDIA. SparseMatVecMul is
taken from a paper by NVIDIA (Efficient Sparse Matrix-Vector
Multiplication on CUDA", Bell and Garland).
